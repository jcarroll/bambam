bambam is a keyboard and mouse game for babies written in Python.
Pressing letter keys prints them in random locations and colours.
Pressing any other key draws little pictures in random locations.
Dragging the mouse while the mouse button is pressed draws in randomly changing
colours.
The screen is cleared at random.
.SH NOTES
\fBTo quit, type quit in the game\fR.
.PP
To turn the sound off and on, type mute and unmute, respectively, in the game.
.PP
bambam loads images (GIF, JPEG, PNG and TIFF files) and sounds (WAV and OGG
files) from the following directories:
.IP \(bu
the \fBdata\fR directory distributed with the game,
.IP \(bu
\fB$XDG_DATA_HOME\fR (usually ~/.local/share/bambam/data)
.PP
When scanning directories for files, bambam \fBdoes\fR follow symbolic links
and descend directories. This makes is easy to have bambam use files located
elsewhere.
.PP
\fBBe aware\fR that there are ways to switch to another application from bambam:
.IP \(bu
some window environments (maintainer suspects this may be true for wayland)
do not make it possible for bambam to grab all key presses.
When using GNOME Shell, pressing the Windows (a.k.a. Super) key will activate
the activities overview.
Please check your environment. If that is the case, then you can try running
bambam in a dedicated X session, for example by running \fBstartx bambam\fR
from a text console;
.IP \(bu
bambam does not block virtual terminal switching (e.g.
CTRL+ALT+F1). See the example 50-dont-vt-switch.conf file if you would like to
block that.
